# Docker-Zero-to-hero Course

Welcome to the Docker Zero-to-Hero Course by Abdul Rahman! This course will guide you from Docker basics to advanced concepts, perfect for beginners and those looking to enhance their containerization skills.

## If you found this repo useful, give it a STAR  

## What is a container ?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Ok, let me make it easy !!!

A container is a bundle of Application, Application libraries required to run your application and the minimum system dependencies.

## Containers vs Virtual Machine 

Containers and virtual machines are both technologies used to isolate applications and their dependencies, but they have some key differences:

    1. Resource Utilization: Containers share the host operating system kernel, making them lighter and faster than VMs. VMs have a full-fledged OS and hypervisor, making them more resource-intensive.

    2. Portability: Containers are designed to be portable and can run on any system with a compatible host operating system. VMs are less portable as they need a compatible hypervisor to run.

    3. Security: VMs provide a higher level of security as each VM has its own operating system and can be isolated from the host and other VMs. Containers provide less isolation, as they share the host operating system.

   4.  Management: Managing containers is typically easier than managing VMs, as containers are designed to be lightweight and fast-moving.



## Why are containers light weight ?

Containers are lightweight because they use a technology called containerization, which allows them to share the host operating system's kernel and libraries, while still providing isolation for the application and its dependencies. This results in a smaller footprint compared to traditional virtual machines, as the containers do not need to include a full operating system. Additionally, Docker containers are designed to be minimal, only including what is necessary for the application to run, further reducing their size.

Let's try to understand this with an example:

Below is the screenshot of official ubuntu base image which you can use for your container. It's just ~ 22 MB, isn't it very small ? on a contrary if you look at official ubuntu VM image it will be close to ~ 2.3 GB. So the container base image is almost 100 times less than VM image.

![Screenshot 2023-02-08 at 3 12 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43399466/217493284-85411ae0-b283-4475-9729-6b082e35fc7d.png)


To provide a better picture of files and folders that containers base images have and files and folders that containers use from host operating system (not 100 percent accurate -> varies from base image to base image). Refer below.



### Files and Folders in containers base images

```
    /bin: contains binary executable files, such as the ls, cp, and ps commands.

    /sbin: contains system binary executable files, such as the init and shutdown commands.

    /etc: contains configuration files for various system services.

    /lib: contains library files that are used by the binary executables.

    /usr: contains user-related files and utilities, such as applications, libraries, and documentation.

    /var: contains variable data, such as log files, spool files, and temporary files.

    /root: is the home directory of the root user.
```



### Files and Folders that containers use from host operating system

```
    The host's file system: Docker containers can access the host file system using bind mounts, which allow the container to read and write files in the host file system.

    Networking stack: The host's networking stack is used to provide network connectivity to the container. Docker containers can be connected to the host's network directly or through a virtual network.

    System calls: The host's kernel handles system calls from the container, which is how the container accesses the host's resources, such as CPU, memory, and I/O.

    Namespaces: Docker containers use Linux namespaces to create isolated environments for the container's processes. Namespaces provide isolation for resources such as the file system, process ID, and network.

    Control groups (cgroups): Docker containers use cgroups to limit and control the amount of resources, such as CPU, memory, and I/O, that a container can access.
    
```

It's important to note that while a container uses resources from the host operating system, it is still isolated from the host and other containers, so changes to the container do not affect the host or other containers.

**Note:** There are multiple ways to reduce your VM image size as well, but I am just talking about the default for easy comparision and understanding.

so, in a nutshell, container base images are typically smaller compared to VM images because they are designed to be minimalist and only contain the necessary components for running a specific application or service. VMs, on the other hand, emulate an entire operating system, including all its libraries, utilities, and system files, resulting in a much larger size. 

I hope it is now very clear why containers are light weight in nature.



## Docker


### What is Docker ?

Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications, which means, using Docker you can build container images, run the images to create containers and also push these containers to container regestries such as DockerHub, Quay.io and so on.

In simple words, you can understand as `containerization is a concept or technology` and `Docker Implements Containerization`.


### Docker Architecture ?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43399466/217507877-212d3a60-143a-4a1d-ab79-4bb615cb4622.png)

The above picture, clearly indicates that Docker Deamon is brain of Docker. If Docker Deamon is killed, stops working for some reasons, Docker is brain dead :p (sarcasm intended).

### Docker LifeCycle 

We can use the above Image as reference to understand the lifecycle of Docker.

There are three important things,

1. docker build -> builds docker images from Dockerfile
2. docker run   -> runs container from docker images
3. docker push  -> push the container image to public/private regestries to share the docker images.

![Screenshot 2023-02-08 at 4 32 13 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43399466/217511949-81f897b2-70ee-41d1-b229-38d0572c54c7.png)



### Understanding the terminology (Inspired from Docker Docs)


#### Docker daemon

The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.


#### Docker client

The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.


#### Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac, Windows or Linux environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes the Docker daemon (dockerd), the Docker client (docker), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. For more information, see Docker Desktop.


#### Docker registries

A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.

When you use the docker pull or docker run commands, the required images are pulled from your configured registry. When you use the docker push command, your image is pushed to your configured registry.
Docker objects

When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects.


#### Dockerfile

Dockerfile is a file where you provide the steps to build your Docker Image. 


#### Images

An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the ubuntu image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.

You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.



## INSTALL DOCKER

A very detailed instructions to install Docker are provide in the below link

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

For Demo, 

You can create an Ubuntu EC2 Instance on AWS and run the below commands to install docker.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
```


### Start Docker and Grant Access

A very common mistake that many beginners do is, After they install docker using the sudo access, they miss the step to Start the Docker daemon and grant acess to the user they want to use to interact with docker and run docker commands.

Always ensure the docker daemon is up and running.

A easy way to verify your Docker installation is by running the below command

```
docker run hello-world
```

If the output says:

```
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/create": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
See 'docker run --help'.
```

This can mean two things, 
1. Docker deamon is not running.
2. Your user does not have access to run docker commands.


### Start Docker daemon

You use the below command to verify if the docker daemon is actually started and Active

```
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If you notice that the docker daemon is not running, you can start the daemon using the below command

```
sudo systemctl start docker
```


### Grant Access to your user to run docker commands

To grant access to your user to run the docker command, you should add the user to the Docker Linux group. Docker group is create by default when docker is installed.

```
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

In the above command `ubuntu` is the name of the user, you can change the username appropriately.

**NOTE:** : You need to logout and login back for the changes to be reflected.


### Docker is Installed, up and running 🥳🥳

Use the same command again, to verify that docker is up and running.

```
docker run hello-world
```

Output should look like:

```
....
....
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
...
```


## Great Job, Now start with the examples folder to write your first Dockerfile and move to the next examples. Happy Learning :)

### You must be feeling like a champ already 


### What is a Container Runtime?

A container runtime is the software responsible for running containers. It manages container lifecycles, ensuring the isolation of resources while sharing the underlying host's operating system. Some common runtimes include:
- **Docker** (for Docker containers)
- **containerd** (Docker’s runtime)
- **CRI-O** (for Kubernetes)

### Who Invented Docker?

Docker was originally developed by Solomon Hykes at dotCloud in 2013. It evolved into a significant open-source project and is now a key part of many modern software deployment environments.

# Docker Networking and Volumes: Simple Explanation

# Docker Networking

Networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with the host system. Containers run isolated from the host system
and need a way to communicate with each other and with the host system.

By default, Docker provides two network drivers for you, the bridge and the overlay drivers. 

```
docker network ls
```

```
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
xxxxxxxxxxxx        none                null
xxxxxxxxxxxx        host                host
xxxxxxxxxxxx        bridge              bridge
```


### Bridge Networking

The default network mode in Docker. It creates a private network between the host and containers, allowing
containers to communicate with each other and with the host system.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43399466/217745543-f40e5614-ac34-4b78-85a9-91b24512388d.png)

If you want to secure your containers and isolate them from the default bridge network you can also create your own bridge network.

```
docker network create -d bridge my_bridge
```

Now, if you list the docker networks, you will see a new network.

```
docker network ls

NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER
xxxxxxxxxxxx        bridge              bridge
xxxxxxxxxxxx        my_bridge           bridge
xxxxxxxxxxxx        none                null
xxxxxxxxxxxx        host                host
```

This new network can be attached to the containers, when you run these containers.

```
docker run -d --net=my_bridge --name db training/postgres
```

This way, you can run multiple containers on a single host platform where one container is attached to the default network and 
the other is attached to the my_bridge network.

These containers are completely isolated with their private networks and cannot talk to each other.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43399466/217748680-8beefd0a-8181-4752-a098-a905ebed5d2a.png)


However, you can at any point of time, attach the first container to my_bridge network and enable communication

```
docker network connect my_bridge web
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43399466/217748726-7bb347d0-3736-4f89-bdff-31d240b15150.png)


### Host Networking

This mode allows containers to share the host system's network stack, providing direct access to the host system's network.

To attach a host network to a Docker container, you can use the --network="host" option when running a docker run command. When you use this option, the container has access to the host's network stack, and shares the host's network namespace. This means that the container will use the same IP address and network configuration as the host.

Here's an example of how to run a Docker container with the host network:

```
docker run --network="host" <image_name> <command>
```

Keep in mind that when you use the host network, the container is less isolated from the host system, and has access to all of the host's network resources. This can be a security risk, so use the host network with caution.

Additionally, not all Docker image and command combinations are compatible with the host network, so it's important to check the image documentation or run the image with the --network="bridge" option (the default network mode) first to see if there are any compatibility issues.

### Overlay Networking

This mode enables communication between containers across multiple Docker host machines, allowing containers to be connected to a single network even when they are running on different hosts.

### Macvlan Networking

This mode allows a container to appear on the network as a physical host rather than as a container.


# Docker Volumes

## Problem Statement

It is a very common requirement to persist the data in a Docker container beyond the lifetime of the container. However, the file system
of a Docker container is deleted/removed when the container dies. 

## Solution

There are 2 different ways how docker solves this problem.

1. Volumes
2. Bind Directory on a host as a Mount

### Volumes 

Volumes aims to solve the same problem by providing a way to store data on the host file system, separate from the container's file system, 
so that the data can persist even if the container is deleted and recreated.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43399466/218018334-286d8949-d155-4d55-80bc-24827b02f9b1.png)


Volumes can be created and managed using the docker volume command. You can create a new volume using the following command:

```
docker volume create <volume_name>
```

Once a volume is created, you can mount it to a container using the -v or --mount option when running a docker run command. 

For example:

```
docker run -it -v <volume_name>:/data <image_name> /bin/bash
```

This command will mount the volume <volume_name> to the /data directory in the container. Any data written to the /data directory
inside the container will be persisted in the volume on the host file system.

### Bind Directory on a host as a Mount

Bind mounts also aims to solve the same problem but in a complete different way.

Using this way, user can mount a directory from the host file system into a container. Bind mounts have the same behavior as volumes, but
are specified using a host path instead of a volume name. 

For example, 

```
docker run -it -v <host_path>:<container_path> <image_name> /bin/bash
```

## Key Differences between Volumes and Bind Directory on a host as a Mount

Volumes are managed, created, mounted and deleted using the Docker API. However, Volumes are more flexible than bind mounts, as 
they can be managed and backed up separately from the host file system, and can be moved between containers and hosts.

In a nutshell, Bind Directory on a host as a Mount are appropriate for simple use cases where you need to mount a directory from the host file system into
a container, while volumes are better suited for more complex use cases where you need more control over the data being persisted
in the container.


## Advanced Steps to Create and Use a Docker Volume

##### 1. **Create a Volume**
First, you create a volume using the `docker volume create` command. This volume will live on the host's file system.

```bash
docker volume create my_data_volume
```

- **Volume created**: Docker creates this volume in the background, but it doesn’t automatically attach to any container.

##### 2. **Mount a Volume to a Container**
When you run a container, you can **mount** the volume to a directory in the container using the `-v` option or `--mount`.

- **Mount the volume** to `/data` in the container:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -v my_data_volume:/data --name my_container ubuntu
  ```

In this example:
- **`my_data_volume`** is the volume you created.
- **`/data`** is the directory in the container where the volume is mounted.

##### 3. **How Mount Points Work**
- When you mount the volume to a container, Docker automatically connects the volume to the specified directory (e.g., `/data`) inside the container.
- **Mount Point**: This means that any files written inside `/data` in the container are actually stored on the host’s file system, in the volume you created.
- If you stop or delete the container, the data remains in the **volume** on the host and can be used by another container.

##### 4. **View Where the Volume is Stored**
To inspect the details of the volume (such as where it's stored on the host), you can use:

```bash
docker volume inspect my_data_volume
```

This command will output details like:
```json
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2024-10-23T12:00:00Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/my_data_volume/_data",
        "Name": "my_data_volume",
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
```

- **Mountpoint**: This shows where the volume is located on the host. In this case, it’s in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/my_data_volume/_data`. This is the directory where all the data written to `/data` in the container will be saved on the host.

##### 5. **Using Volumes Across Multiple Containers**
You can use the same volume with multiple containers, so they share the same data. Here’s an example:

- Run a second container using the same volume:
  ```bash
  docker run -it -v my_data_volume:/data ubuntu bash
  ```

- Both containers (`my_container` and this new one) can now access and modify the same data in `/data`, since it's stored in the `my_data_volume`.

#### Example: Writing Data to a Volume

1. **Write a file in the container**:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, Docker Volumes!" > /data/hello.txt
   ```

2. **Check the file on the host**: 
   Since the volume is mounted, this file will be saved in the volume’s directory on the host (`/var/lib/docker/volumes/my_data_volume/_data`).

3. **Stop the container**: 
   ```bash
   docker stop my_container
   ```

4. **Start a new container using the same volume**: 
   ```bash
   docker run -it -v my_data_volume:/data ubuntu bash
   ```

5. **Check if the file exists**:
   ```bash
   cat /data/hello.txt
   ```

   You'll see the content `"Hello, Docker Volumes!"` because it was saved in the volume.

---

### Key Points about Docker Volumes:
- **Persistent Data**: Data in volumes persists even when the container is removed.
- **Isolation**: Volumes are isolated from the container’s file system, ensuring independence between the container and stored data.
- **Multi-Container Sharing**: Multiple containers can share a volume, allowing them to read and write to the same data location.
- **Portable**: Volumes are portable between containers on the same host and can be backed up separately from the container’s lifecycle.

Now you can easily manage communication and data storage between your containers!

## Before Learning Kubernetes

Before diving into Kubernetes, it's important to understand:
1. **Docker Basics**: Building, running, and managing containers.
2. **Container Runtime**: The engine that runs your containers.
3. **Networking**: How containers communicate with each other.
4. **Volumes**: Persistent storage for containers.
