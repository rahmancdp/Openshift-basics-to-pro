## üöÄ Working with OpenShift Dedicated

Once you have access to your dedicated OpenShift cluster, you can begin deploying applications, creating resources, and managing configurations. Below are some common tasks to get you started:

# **Downloading and Using `oc` CLI**

To manage OpenShift resources, you can use the `oc` command-line tool:

1. **Download the CLI**:
   - In the OpenShift console, click on the **question mark (?) icon** in the top-right corner.
   - Select **Command Line Tools** and download the appropriate `oc` binary for your OS.

2. **Log in Using the CLI**:
   - Click on your username in the top-right corner and select **Copy Login Command**.
   - Copy the `oc login` command displayed and paste it into your terminal.
   - The execution should done in oc where **oc.exe** file is extracted.

   For example:
   ```bash
   oc login https://api.dedicated-cluster1.us-east-1.openshiftapps.com:6443 --token=<your_token>
   ```

### 1. **Creating and Managing Projects**

Projects in OpenShift are equivalent to namespaces in Kubernetes. Before deploying any resources, create a new project:

```bash
oc new-project my-app
```

Switch to the newly created project:

```bash
oc project my-app
```

### 2. **Deploying a Sample Application**

Deploy a Node.js application from a GitHub repository using the `oc new-app` command:

```bash
oc new-app nodejs~https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex
```

This command will automatically create a deployment, build the image from the source code, and deploy the application pods.

### 3. **Creating and Managing Pods and Deployments**

You can manually create Pods and Deployments using YAML files or commands:

**Create a Deployment:**

```bash
oc create deployment my-deployment --image=nginx
```

**Scale the Deployment:**

```bash
oc scale deployment my-deployment --replicas=3
```

### 4. **Exposing Your Application**

After deploying your application, expose it using a service and route:

**Expose a Service:**

```bash
oc expose deployment my-deployment --port=80
```

**Create a Route:**

```bash
oc expose svc/my-deployment
```

The route URL will be displayed, and you can access your application from a web browser.


### 6. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**

Use the following commands to view logs and debug issues:

- **View Logs**:
  ```bash
  oc logs pod-name
  ```

- **Describe a Resource**:
  ```bash
  oc describe pod pod-name
  ```
